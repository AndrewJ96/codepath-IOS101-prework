# App Brainstorming

## Favorite 3-5 applications and 2-3 likeable features per application
* VS Code
    * Change Theme (Dark, Light, Modern Dark, etc)
    * Extensions that support a variety of programming languages
    * Built in terminal/command line interface
* StepsApp
    * Counts my steps automatically throughout the day
    * Uses biometrics to calculate calories burned from step count
* Piazza
    * Allows me to make a private or public post 
    * Allows me to search for similar questions based off keywords
  
## Personal App Idea: Calorie and Nutrition App

I would like to build an App that allows me to count the calories I have consumed throughout the day to make it easier for me to not overeat during the stressful semester. I want to be able to enter my biometrics (weight, height, etc.) as well as my activity level and the app uses modern nutrition and exercise science to determine my maintenance calories. Additionally, I want to be able to enter a weight loss goal and timeframe and the app determines my daily calorie defecit to make that happen. I would also like to know the macronutirent breakdown of the food I have eaten (carbs, fat, protein).
